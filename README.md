Summer
======

A Go framework for performing dependency injection with the goal of reducing object
creation boilerplate.


## Installation

    go get github.com/felixalias/summer

To run included tests:

    cd $GOROOT/src/pkg/github.com/felixalias/summer
    go test


## Status

Summer is functional for my needs. All features listed are fully implemented, working, and testing.
It is capable of:

  - Injecting dependencies into your structs by name
  - Injecting dependencies automatically by matching types

In addition,

  - Summer is [fully documented](http://godoc.org/github.com/felixalias/summer)
  - Summer has thorough test coverage


## Quick Start

See the examples for [PerformInjections](http://godoc.org/github.com/felixalias/summer/#Container.PerformInjections) and [InjectInto](http://godoc.org/github.com/felixalias/summer/#Container.InjectInto).

```go
import "github.com/felixalias/summer"

type MyService struct {
    MyDependency     string `summer:"StringDependency"`
    MyAutoDependency string `summer:",auto"`
}
service := new(MyService)

container := NewContainer()
container.Add("injected value", "StringDependency")
container.Add(service, "")

ok := container.PerformInjections()
```
